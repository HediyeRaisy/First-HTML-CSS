                <p><strong>Fashion</strong> is a popular aesthetic expression at a particular time and place
                    and in a specific context, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup,
                    hairstyle, and body proportions.[1] Whereas a trend often connotes a peculiar aesthetic expression
                    and often lasting shorter than a season, fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression 
                    traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections.[2] Style is an expression that lasts over many 
                    seasons and is often connected to cultural movements and social markers, symbols, class, and culture (ex. Baroque, Rococo, etc.).
                        According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes "the latest fashion, the latest difference."[3]</p>

                <p>A <strong>Fashion week</strong> is a fashion industry event, lasting approximately one week, where fashion designers, brands or "houses" display their latest collections in runway fashion shows to buyers and the media. These events influence trends for the current and upcoming seasons.
                The most prominent fashion weeks are held in the fashion capitals of the world; New York, London, Milan, and Paris, or the "Big Four" which receive the majority of press coverage.
                As the fashion scene turns more multipolar in the 21st century, other centers such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Sydney, São Paulo, Beijing, Singapore, Seoul, Berlin, Dubai, Los Angeles, Madrid, Monaco, Rome, Taipei, Vancouver, Copenhagen, Toronto, and Tokyo host fashion weeks.</p>

                alt="A quote about fashion">
                <p>On a larger scale, fashion is important because it represents our history and helps to tell the story of the world. Clothes began as a necessity but they gained
                    their power early on when certain groups wore specific styles, making them popular. An early example: Levi jeans were worn among miners because the copper rivets
                    used at points of stress within the jeans expand the lifespan of the jeans, making them a favorite among the blue-collar worker. Levi’s saw an opportunity and quickly
                        created a solution and even after more than 150 years, they still remain an iconic denim brand. </p>
                
                <p>From a designing perspective, fashion gives you complete control in delivering any message that you desire. Fashion is more than a hobby or interest, for some, it’s a way of
                    life (much like it is for me). It’s one of the surest forms of expression and you get to choose how you use it and what you want to do with it.</p>
